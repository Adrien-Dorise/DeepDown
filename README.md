# Deep Down
Deep Down is a game created for the first AI and Games Jam. It was created with the harsh time constraints of one week. Quite harsh to use deep learning!
It is an action RPG where the characters are controlled with neural networks
Reinforcement learning is used for the main characters, each of them with a different role, each of them with a differently trained network. 
The goal was to make them work together to finsih the dungeon.

Go take a look to the game!
